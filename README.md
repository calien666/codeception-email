# Codeception Email Testing Framework

This framework defines a testing Trait (interface) which allows standardized email testing across various email testing services, such as

* [MailHog] with the [MailHogModule]
* [MailCatcher] with the [MailCatcherModule]
* [Mailtrap] with the [MailtrapModule]

```
seeInOpenedEmailBCCField($expected)

Warning: it is possible for an email to have its BCC field empty, it doesn't mean that another instance of the same email doesn't exist.
```
dontSeeInOpenedEmailBCCField($expected)
```
Checks that the BCC field of the opened email does not contain $expected

Warning: it is possible for an email to have its BCC field empty, it doesn't mean that another instance of the same email doesn't exist.
```
seeInEmailBCCField($email, $expected)
```
Checks that the BCC field of $email contains $expected

Warning: it is possible for an email to have its BCC field empty, it doesn't mean that another instance of the same email doesn't exist.
```
dontSeeInEmailBCCField($email, $expected)
```
Checks that the BCC field of $email does not contain $expected

Warning: it is possible for an email to have its BCC field empty, it doesn't mean that another instance of the same email doesn't exist.
```
seeInOpenedEmailPriority($expected)
```
Checks that the priority of the opened email is $expected
```
dontSeeInOpenedEmailPriority($expected)
```
Checks that the priority of the opened email is not $expected
```
seeInEmailPriority($email, $expected)
```
Checks that the priority of $email is $expected
```
dontSeeInEmailPriority($email, $expected)
```
Checks that the priority of $email is not $expected

### Developing For New Testing Services
A base trait defining the interface the test methods require is available in `\Codeception\Email\EmailServiceProvider`. All of these methods need to be overloaded in a new Service Provider.  They are protected as they are only used by the testing layer, not by the user himself.
```
getCurrentInbox()
```
Returns the complete current inbox
```
getUnreadInbox()
```
Returns the inbox containing unread emails
```
getOpenedEmail($fetchNextUnread = FALSE)
```
Main method called by the tests, providing either the currently open email or the next unread one
```
getEmailBody($email)
```
Returns the body of an email
```
getEmailSubject($email)
```
Returns the subject of an email
```
getSender($email)
```
Returns the string containing the sender of the email
```
getEmailTo($email)
```
Returns the string containing the persons included in the To field
```
getEmailCC($email)
```
Returns the string containing the persons included in the CC field
```
getEmailBCC($email)
```
Returns the string containing the persons included in the BCC field
```
getEmailRecipients($email)
```
Returns the string containing all of the recipients, such as To, CC and if provided BCC
```
grabBodyFromEmail
```
Returns the email body as string
```
$email_body = $I->grabBodyFromEmail('text/html');
$doc = new DOMDocument();
$doc->loadHTML($email_body);
$login = $doc->getElementById('login')->textContent;
$password = $doc->getElementById('password')->textContent;
```
Fetch login & password from 'text/html' email MIME-part.

### To Do
While this framework should be sufficient for most email testing scenarios, the remaining features need to be implemented
* HTML and Plain Text content
* Attachments
* Priority
